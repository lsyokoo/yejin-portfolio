            Born and raised in Seoul, Yejin Han discovered her passion for storytelling through visuals at an early age. As she grew, this passion evolved into a deep interest in creating meaningful narratives through design. Driven by the desire to craft art that resonates with people in their everyday lives, she pursued a career in fashion design and moved to New York to study at Parsons School of Design.
          </p>
    
        <p>Currently, being a student in school, Yejin's work is focused on exploring diverse styles and aesthetics, with each project reflecting a fresh perspective. Her inspiration often draws from traditional heritage, daily human experiences, and personal memories. She is committed to creating high-quality, thoughtfully made garments that are designed to endure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Attention to detail is at the core of Yejin's design philosophy—even the smallest elements need to be carefully considered, whether or not they are immediately visible to the audience. Through her work, she aims to blend storytelling with craftsmanship, offering timeless pieces that connect emotionally and practically with those who wear them.
            </p>

              We often live our lives forgetting things.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              It could be items we used to love, thoughts that used to mingle around constantly in our minds, or values we were once committed to following. Hoping to create something that will last, embedded in people's daily lives, and remembered like a light scent that brings out old memories, Yejin Han's work focuses on all the things that are too often forgotten. Inspired by everything we tend to pass over in our daily lives, and creating a nostalgic space for people to return back to what they usually overlook.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              For the people who live ordinary lives, the people we know, the people we love, people who we are happy to see every day and look forward to meeting in the future.
